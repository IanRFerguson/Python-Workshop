    "# Using Python in Psychology\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Rather than dive into a thorough \"how-to\" of Python syntax, this overview will focus primarily on applying Python knowlege to the domain of psychology and neuroscience. For a more thorough introduction to Python, I've created a series of notebooks that you can find [HERE](https://github.com/IanRFerguson/Python-Workshop)\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "This overview will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* Automated stimulus generation\n",
    "* Scraping data from unconventional sources\n",
    "* Applying Machine Learning to Psych and Neuroscience\n",

    "## What are some strengths of Python?\n",
    "----------\n",
    "Python is a **general-purpose language** - in other words, it can be used to write software and applications.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "Relative to other general purpose programming languages (e.g., Java, C#), **Python** utilizes minimalist syntax to faciliate clean, readable code\n",
