# Python Workshop
-----------------
Hey howdy! Welcome to a <b>very</b> rudimentary introduction to the Python programming language. While I'm no expert, I'm hoping that the tools in this repository are helpful in getting you off the ground with Python.

## 00_Notebooks
----------------
* Contains (hopefully) helpful walkthroughs on a range of topics
* Make sure to start with the first notebook if you're brand new to Python - that will guide you through the installation process

## 01_Exercises
----------------
* Still a work in progress!
* This repo will eventually have interactive exercises to show off what you've learned!
