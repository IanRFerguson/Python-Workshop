    "**Option 1** <br>\n",
    "Go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) and follow the download instructions for your operating system. This will include the Python installer, as well as pip (a command line tool that allows you to install + upgrade Python packages ... but more on that later). Next, you'll want to go to the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) page and install Jupyter at the command line. This will allow you to use Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook (like what we're using now!)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2** <br>\n",
    "Install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes Python, Jupyter, and several crucial packages. It's optimized for data science, which may be handy considering your personal interests. However, there is nothing in this distribution that you can't also install with pip. *Sooooo*, it is entirely up to you!"
